# 5G IS COMING

## Project Overview
The major project of the course EAC594 that aims to promoting the student's business writing ability and critical thinking.


## The Project
In teams of 3-5 students you are asked to investigate the impact 5G will have on a specific career field (preferably your own) and report on your findings in the form of a slide report. Content may focus on organizational and occupational processes, efficiencies, and/or financials.  Some teams will be interdisciplinary, bringing together knowledge from a variety of computer programming, networking, and business perspectives.  Once the research is complete, students will prepare a collaborative report that should do the following:
- Provide an overview of 5G wireless connectivity, focusing on one particular use of 5G in a specific business sector or company
- Explain how 5G will work within a business sector or company with the goal of discovering what impact it will have on (choose three areas)
  - accounting, banking, and finances,
  - collaboration, communication and conferencing,
  - customer service,
  - customs and deliveries,
  - efficiencies, tasks, and workflow, 
  - occupations, employment, and career searches,
  - office usage and remote work, and/or
  - transportation and commutes.
